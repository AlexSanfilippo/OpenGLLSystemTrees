Welcome to my Lindenmayer Systems in OpenGL Project.  Briefly, this is an art project I made after completing a basic tutorial on OpenGL.  The program procedurally 
generates tree-like meshes which are colored and animated by the shader in GLSL.  


1. HOW TO RUN
     This program should be runnable on any windows machine.  After downloading, simply double click the .exe file (named OpenGLLsystemTrees) to run the program. 
     
2. MAIN CONTROLS
     Space - Generate a new tree
     C - change shader color scheme
     G - play a simple "growth" animation on the tree (note: very unrealistic!)
     
3. Other Controls
     R - toggle rotating camera and "fly" camera
     WASD and Mouse - control the "fly" camera
     J - tell the shader to draw no triangles
     K - tell the shader to draw all of the triangles
     I - increase the number of traingles drawn (NOTE: will exceed number of triangles in model, leading to buggy output and possible crashes)
